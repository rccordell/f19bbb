During the semester we will explore a range of book types and textual technologies, and many of these will provide an opportunity for you to create small-scale projects. We will begin a number of these together in class sessions. You will choose a select number, based on your chosen grading contract, to complete fully and submit. These minor projects will help you develop skills necessary to execute your final book project and give you space to experiment with different approaches and techniques. Each of these projects will require you to submit a central textual artifact—whether physical or digital—which will be assessed for its creativity and execution. In addition, each minor project should include a brief written statement (~1 page) outlining your goals and approaches. Any given project is due within one week of the class in which it is assigned.
