"Building a (Better) Book" is an experiential course that moves between discussion of readings and applied activities each week. 

In order to help you attend closely to our course texts and prepare for our discussions, each week you should prepare a few paragraphs responding to the core readings. This means a few paragraphs **in total**, *NOT* a few paragraphs per text. Your entries should synthesize and bring readings into conversation, and should focus on a few ideas you want to highlight rather than attempting to summarize everything in the readings. These entries should be prepared, roughly, in the style of an annotated bibliography. It will be easiest to complete this assignment if you jot down notes and ideas while reading. These responses are due before our class discusses a given week's readings (see below for method of submission).

Later in the week, you will expand its entry, responding to our class' activities. You should highlight aspects of the activities brought into relief by our readings, or vice versa, or point to disjunctures between theory and praxis. This expanded section should be no more than 1-2 paragraph(s) aimed at processing the experiential dimensions of the course. *Note: some weeks will not include a new activity, but only studio time. In those weeks you need not write more in your fieldbook later in the week.*

## Organizing Your Fieldbook

Your fieldbook will be a collection of Markdown or `.md` files collected in the class' [Github Repository](). We will learn how to write in Markdown and contribute to the Github repository in the first days of the semester. 

You should name your files following the following convention:

`YYYY-MM-DD-fieldbook-NAME-OR-PSEUDONYM.md`

You should draft each fieldbook entry in its own `.md` file, following the naming convention outlined above, and commit it to your fieldbook repository prior to the first class of each week. *To emphasize: each fieldbook entry should be saved as a separate file in your Github repository.*

You will commit each file at least twice: once before the beginning of the week, when you've written in response to the readings, and once later in the week, when you've added more prose in response to our class activities.

### Flexibility

This is a challenging and full class. The semester will include thirteen weeks of readings. To give you some flexibility, you may choose to forgo fieldbook entries several times during the semester, in line with your chosen grading contract. I strongly recommend you not delay starting this work, but instead begin early and work steadily so that you can use this flexibility as the inevitable stresses of the semester emerge.
