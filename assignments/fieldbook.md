"Building a (Better) Book" is an experiential course that moves between discussion of readings and applied activities each week. 

In order to help you attend closely to our course texts and prepare for each class, each week you should prepare a few paragraphs responding to the core readings. This means a few paragraphs **in total**, *NOT* a few paragraphs per text. Your entries should synthesize and bring readings into conversation, and should focus on a few ideas you want to highlight rather than attempting to summarize everything in the readings. These entries should be prepared, roughly, in the style of an annotated bibliography. It will be easiest to complete this assignment if you jot down notes and ideas while reading.  

You should draft each fieldbook entry in its own `.md` file, following the naming convention outlined above, and commit it to your fieldbook repository prior to the first class of each week. *To emphasize: each fieldbook entry should be saved as a separate file in your Github repository.*

## Organizing Your Fieldbook

Your fieldbook will be a collection of Markdown or `.md` files collected in the class' [Github Repository](). We will learn how to write in Markdown and contribute to the Github repository in the first days of the semester. 

You should name your files following the following convention:

`YYYY-MM-DD-fieldbook-NAME-OR-PSEUDONYM.md`

### Flexibility

This is a challenging and full class. The semester will include thirteen weeks of readings. To give you some flexibility, you may choose to forgo fieldbook entries several times during the semester, in line with your chosen grading contract. I strongly recommend you not delay starting this work, but instead begin early and work steadily so that you can use this flexibility as the inevitable stresses of the semester emerge.
