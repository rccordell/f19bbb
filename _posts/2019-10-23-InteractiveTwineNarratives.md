Today we'll be experimenting with [Twine](http://twinery.org/), "an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories." Twine was used most famously to map out the story for the ["Bandersnatch" episode](https://www.wired.com/story/black-mirror-bandersnatch-interactive-episode/) of *Black Mirror*. 

You can use Twine online or download the application for your computer. Allison Parrish's [A Quick Twine (2.2+) Tutorial](http://catn.decontextualize.com/twine/) is a great introduction to the platform and some basic macros and variables that can extend the platform's capabilities. We will refer to it throughout today's class.

I've also prepared a basic [Twine interpretation of the first chapter of *Moby Dick*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ihhbqml4inayu0h/Loomings.html?dl=0), which you can view *or*, more usefully, download and import into Twine so you can see how it is set up. If you download the HTML file, you can use the "Import from file" option within Twine to investigate the story's structure.
